# FourInARow

"Four in a Row" is a classic strategy game in this situation coded in Ruby using the Ruby2d library. The objective of the game is to connect four of your colored discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Players take turns dropping their colored discs into the top of a vertical grid, with the disc falling to the lowest available space. The game is played by two players on the same computer. It's a perfect time pass game for those who love strategy games.
